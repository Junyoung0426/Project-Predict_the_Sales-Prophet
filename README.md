# Project-Predict_the_Sales

## Introduction

This project is a data analysis and prediction project aimed at predicting the daily sales of stores. The project's goal is to develop a model to predict future sales based on given sales and related data.

## Data

- Dataset: [[Source or Link to Dataset]](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rossmann-store-sales/data)

- Data Format: CSV File

- Data Columns:
  - Id: An identifier representing a unique (Store, Date) combination within the test dataset.
   Store: A unique identifier for each store.

  - Sales: The target variable, representing the daily turnover for a store.

- Customers: The number of customers in the store on a given day.

- Open: An indicator for whether the store was open (0 = closed, 1 = open).

- StateHoliday: An indicator of a state holiday. Values include "a" for public holidays, "b" for Easter holidays, "c" for Christmas, and "0" for no holiday.

- SchoolHoliday: An indicator of whether the (Store, Date) was affected by the closure of public schools.

- StoreType: Categorizes stores into different models, labeled as "a," "b," "c," or "d."

- Assortment: Describes the assortment level, labeled as "a" for basic, "b" for extra, and "c" for extended.

- CompetitionDistance: The distance in meters to the nearest competitor store.

- CompetitionOpenSince[Month/Year]: Provides the approximate year and month when the nearest competitor store opened.

- Promo: Indicates whether a store is running a promotion on a given day.

- Promo2: A consecutive and continuing promotion for some stores (0 = not participating, 1 = participating).

- Promo2Since[Year/Week]: Describes the year and calendar week when the store started participating in Promo2.

- PromoInterval: Describes the consecutive intervals when Promo2 is started, specifying the months when the promotion begins.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into the following phases:

1. Data Loading: Load the provided dataset into Python and explore the data.

2. Data Preprocessing: Handle missing data, outliers, and duplicate entries, and transform the data into a time-series format.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore the data through distribution analysis, statistics, and visualization.

4. Time Series Modeling: Use the Prophet model to train and validate a sales prediction model.

5. Prediction and Visualization: Use the trained model to predict future daily sales and create visualizations.

## Results

Summarize and explain the key findings and results obtained from the project. Provide predictive results and visual graphs.

## Usage

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Download the code and data to your local environment.

2. Install the necessary Python packages.

3. Execute the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to start the project.

4. Review the results and visualizations.
